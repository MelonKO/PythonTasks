# PythonTasks
## Introduction
This repository contains a number of tasks for learning Python.

## Source files
The text of the problem with the proposed solution is located in the `src` directory under the names `task_[0-15]`. 

## Tests
The tests directory contains unit `tests` for each task under the name `test_task_[0-15]`, respectively. 

The tests were run on two versions of Python: 3.12 and 3.8.

The built-in unittest module is used for testing. To run it, you can use the command `python3 -m unittest discover` to run all tests, or `python3 -m unittest tests/test_task_[0-15].py` to run the test for a specific job.
